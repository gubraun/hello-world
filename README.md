# hello-world
This is a test project for Coverity. It will
- mount an Azure file share with the Coverity analysis tools installed
- run Coverity analysis (build and analyze)
- commit the results to a Coverity server (also hosted in Azure)

The Coverity Connect server Azure VM needs to be running before the job is started.
